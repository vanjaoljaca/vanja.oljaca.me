# Bar Raiser Training



* Two schools: 
  * you know the answer and get it where it needs to go
  * every touch is a failure
* Style vs technique
  * Some moves are stylistic preferences, optional
  * Some moves are required to keep the ball from going out of bounds
  * Undeniable that some things cause other things
* Stories
  * Team was pushing for L5, sys design was lacking, He didn't know queues and smoething? team pushed back he can just learn what a queue is its easy!
    * Yeah sure its easy, none of this is hard, its just a million things to learn and we can't test it all we can just sample and see how much of the sample comes up positive
  * My story with Vinay: 
    * I almost didnt get in because my sys design was bad. Nick fought very hard to get me in based on all my other factors. They just got me in as L4 even though I had 7 years XP
  * Sonu taking control as mentor
  * The microsoft guy who just wanted to tinker with Alexa
* What did I end up as?
  * Subtley explain that I went with the 'Earns Trust' way
