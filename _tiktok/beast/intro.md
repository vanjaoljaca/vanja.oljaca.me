# Beast Intro



### What I want to say:

1. Hi gymtok, I'm Vanja
2. This is me *flex* small weight ("I'm small, unimpressive")
3. But I wasn't always like this *dum* .... *dum* ... *dum-dum* .
   1. 4, 3, 2, 1
   2. 1000lbs 
   3. Marathon
   4. Finish with deadlift video?
4. 2017 was a great year for me, I hit all my fitness goals
5. Enough to escape the never ending cycle of new PR
   1. [scene in gym, walk up to aads] Bro I'm starting to think adding another 5kg on your deadlift wont solve all my life problems [show aads with his reply]
6. See in australia we have this saying "drink a spoon full of cement & harden up"
7. Turns out that is not a great approach to body care
   1. img: sore back? let me guess. male late 20s works out never stretches
8. So I pivoted. I thought I would never go back to lifting, I put myself 100% into
   1. - singing, dancing, obsession with posture
      - I became a whole new category of person
9. But 5 years later, 
   1. after doing it very wrong at first. the type A-est type B
      1. img meme to nina
10. I started to notice something
11. It was healing
12. Sure enough I looked and this seems aligned with some legit stuff
    1. Tai chi /qing gho
    2. Alexander technique
    3. Somatic healing
13. The Type A goal driven push hard in particular movements mode of being
    1. .. combines with Type B
       1. push as soft as possible, minimal
       2. instead of 45 mins a day 3x a week. 24x7 constant body awareness
       3. Work the tiniest weakest muscles
       4. Notice all vibrations & feelings
       5. and The body heals itself, just give it space. Amazing!
14. [scene cut to outside & walking] Anyway, this year I'm finally making it back into the gym. 
15. The journey is going to be incredible. I'm going to
    1. Dance
    2. Calisthenics
    3. Flips
    4. Return to my bench & running PRs
    5. Stretch goal: dunk
16. Join in and follow, i'm looking for like minded people to grow together

### What am I really trying to say?

*2nd half*

1. Post back injury I thought it was all over for me, but I was wrong.

2. I pivoted to singing 100% and obsessed over posture. I became a whole new category of person.

3. I was later surprised to find out that this work would heal my gym problems.

4. Turns out that there's a bunch of stuff (meditation, alexander technique, somatic massage, mewing, tai chi) that fixes the main issue everyone has: [visual chart: body dissassociation & excessive sitting -> bad posture -> twisted hips weak glutes -> back pain]

5. and the fix is to have fun exploring the 6th sense, proprioception

6. [cut to walking into gym] I'll talk about this more in future videos, but for now I just wanna meet some interesting gym people [song:stronger better faster stronger]

7. thanks for watching *zyzz*
