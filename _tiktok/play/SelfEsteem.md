- He brought a practical perspective, providing strategies for nurturing and sustaining self-esteem.
- I did silly things, eg marathon, but why? why collect achievements?
- "The first step toward change is awareness. The second step is acceptance.”
- "The only person who is educated is the one who has learned how to learn and change.”
- Branden contends that **your self-esteem both \*drives\* and \*depends\* on your behavior in a never-ending cycle**:
- you can ignore your opinion of yourself, but you cannot refrain from having one.
- “I like this movie” guy says he doesnt like it. you dont have to converge on an opinion, but holding your own has a perceived social cost. once self esteem is the goal, the social cost is not even noticeable

**0-5s**: [Direct to camera] "One of the most influential books I’ve read is 'The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem' by Nathaniel Branden." +3    This the kinda thing you want if self actualization is your goal

**5-15s**: [Engaging tone] "Recommended by a work friend who had this giant fish tank at his desk. Like  monitor at his desk – a guy completely happy in his own world."

**15-25s**: [Reflective] "The book connects 'self esteem' to modern psychology by breaking it down into 6 pillars *show* but they all sort of fall into one idea: honest  discussion with the internal judge. Very similar to IFS"

**#1 Critic exists**
**25-35s**: [Thoughtful] The most important point in the book to me is, we already have a guiding principle internally for what we need to be like to be 'high self esteem'. Its there, it exists, inside. The goals are not set externally, and chasing these goals is a dead end. The idea already exists, we just need to extract it with IFS style negotiation.

**#2 You can change**
**35-45s**: [Practical tone] "One takeaway for everyone at home: you're not inherently a high or low self esteem person. Many people try swat away ideas saying that 'that's not me'. But its only by doing these things we consider high self esteem that we grow into a high self esteem person who can do these things. Chicken & egg situation.

**#3 Don't bitch out**
A common pitfall is the fox & sour grapes story. In our quest to not have hurt feelings we might dismiss something we want as sour, because it is effort to get. The problem with this is that we can't selectively mute desires and voices. It has negative consequences.

**45-55s**: [Inspirational] "If it sounds a little fluffy, its not. Its very pragmatic and introduces interesting exercises / ways of looking at the world that make it easier to move forward. I thought it paired well with the book 'nonviolent communication'"

**55-60s**: [Call to action] "Let me know if you've read the book, and how it affected you. ... I thought it was great"
